Capricornus, (Latin: “Goat-horned”), 
also called Capricorn and the Goat, 
in astronomy, zodiacal constellation 
lying in the southern sky between 
Aquarius and Sagittarius, at about 21 
hours right ascension and 20° south 
declination. Its stars are faint; Deneb 
Algedi (Arabic for “kid’s tail”) is the 
brightest star, with a magnitude of 2.9.
In astrology, Capricornus (also called 
Capricorn) is the 10th sign of the zodiac, 
considered as governing the period from 
about December 22 to about January 19. 
One explanation of the fishtail with which 
the goat is often represented is found in 
the Greek myth of Pan, who, to avoid the 
monster Typhon, jumped into the water just 
as he was changing into animal shape. The 
half above water assumed the shape of a 
goat while the lower half, the tail, assumed 
the shape of a fish.
