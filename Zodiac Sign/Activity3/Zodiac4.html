Virgo, (Latin: “Virgin”) in astronomy, 
zodiacal constellation lying in the 
southern sky between Leo and Libra, 
at about 13 hours right ascension and 
2° south declination. The constellation’s 
brightest star, Spica (Latin for “head of 
grain,” also called Alpha Virginis), is the 
15th brightest star in the sky, with a 
magnitude of 1.04. Virgo contains the 
nearest large cluster of galaxies, the Virgo 
cluster, in which is located the giant elliptical 
galaxy Virgo A and PSR 1257+12, the pulsar 
around which the first extrasolar planets were 
discovered in 1992. In astrology, Virgo is the 
sixth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing 
the period from about August 23 to about September 
22. It is represented as a young maiden carrying a 
sheaf of wheat. She is variously identified as a fertility 
goddess (the Babylonian and Assyrian Ishtar, among 
others) or the harvest maiden (the Greek Persephone 
and others).
