Gemini, (Latin: “Twins”) in astronomy, zodiacal 
constellation lying in the northern sky between 
Cancer and Taurus, at about 7 hours right ascension 
and 22° north declination. Its brightest stars are Castor 
and Pollux (Alpha and Beta Geminorum); Pollux is the 
brighter of the two, with a magnitude of 1.15, and is the 
17th brightest star in the sky. The summer solstice, the 
orthernmost point reached by the Sun in its annual 
apparent journey among the stars, lies in Gemini. This 
constellation also contains the isolated pulsar Geminga.
In astrology, Gemini is the third sign of the zodiac, considered 
as governing the period from about May 21 to about June 21. It is 
represented by a set of twins (or in Egyptian astrology by a pair of 
goats and in Arabian astrology by a pair of peacocks). In addition to 
their identification as Castor and Pollux, the twins have also been 
related to other celebrated pairs, such as the younger and older 
Horus or Romulus and Remus.
