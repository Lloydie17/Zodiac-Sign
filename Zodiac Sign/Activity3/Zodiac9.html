Aries contains no very bright stars; the 
brightest star, Hamal (Arabic for “sheep”), 
has a magnitude of 2.0. The first point of 
Aries, or vernal equinox, is an intersection
of the celestial equator with the apparent 
annual pathway of the Sun and the point in 
the sky from which celestial longitude and 
right ascension are measured. The vernal 
equinox no longer lies in Aries but has been 
moved into Pisces by the precession of the 
equinoxes. In astrology, Aries is the first 
sign of the zodiac, considered as governing 
the period from about March 21 to about April 
19. Its representation as a ram is identified 
with the Egyptian god Amon and, in Greek 
mythology, with the ram with the golden fleece, 
on the back of which Phrixus, the son of King 
Athamas, safely fled Thessaly to Colchis, where 
he sacrificed the ram to Zeus, who placed it in the 
heavens as the constellation. The ram’s golden 
fleece was recovered by Jason, leader of the 
Argonauts.
