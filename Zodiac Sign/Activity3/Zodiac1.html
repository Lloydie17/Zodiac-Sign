Sagittarius, (Latin: “Archer”) in astronomy, 
zodiacal constellation in the southern sky lying 
between Capricornus and Scorpius, at about 19 
hours right ascension and 25° south declination. 
The centre of the Milky Way Galaxy lies in the 
radio source Sagittarius A*. Near the western 
border of Sagittarius is the winter solstice, the 
southernmost point reached by the Sun in its 
apparent annual journey among the stars. This 
constellation also contains the Lagoon and Trifid 
nebulas. The brightest star is Kaus Australis (from 
the Arabic for “bow” and the Latin for “southern,”
respectively; it is also called Epsilon Sagittarii), with
a magnitude of 1.9. Many of the stars are arranged 
in the prominent asterism called the Teapot. In astrology,
Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the zodiac, considered as 
governing the period from about November 22 to about 
December 21. It is represented either by a centaur shooting 
a bow and arrow or by an arrow drawn across a bow. The 
identification of Sagittarius as a mounted archer was made 
by the Babylonians as early as the 11th century BCE.
