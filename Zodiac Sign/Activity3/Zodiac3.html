Taurus, (Latin: “Bull”) in astronomy, zodiacal 
constellation lying in the northern sky between 
Aries and Gemini, at about 4 hours 20 minutes 
right ascension and 16° north declination. The 
constellation’s brightest star, Aldebaran (Arabic 
for “the follower”; also called Alpha Tauri), is the 
14th brightest star in the sky, with a magnitude 
of 0.85. The constellation also contains the Crab 
Nebula (M1) and the Pleiades and Hyades star 
clusters. In astrology, Taurus is the second sign 
of the zodiac, considered as governing that 
portion of the year from about April 20 to about 
May 20. Its representation as a bull is related to 
the Greek myth of Zeus, who assumed the form 
of a bull to abduct Europa.
