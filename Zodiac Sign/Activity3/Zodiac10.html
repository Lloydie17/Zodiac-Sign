Cancer, (Latin: “Crab”) in astronomy, zodiacal 
constellation lying in the northern sky between 
Leo and Gemini, at about 8 hours 25 minutes 
right ascension and 20° north declination. It 
contains the well-known star cluster called 
Praesepe, or the Beehive. Its brighest star, 
Al Tarf (Arabic for “the end” [of one of the 
crab’s legs]), also called Beta Cancri, is quite 
dim, with a magnitude of 3.6. In astrology, 
Cancer is the fourth sign of the zodiac, considered 
as governing the period from about June 22 to about 
July 22. Its representation as a crab (or lobster or 
crayfish) is related to the crab in Greek mythology 
that pinched Heracles while he was fighting the 
Lernaean hydra. Crushed by Heracles, the crab 
was rewarded by Heracles’ enemy, Hera, by being 
placed in the heavens.
