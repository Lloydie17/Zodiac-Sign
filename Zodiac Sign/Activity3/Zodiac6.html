Libra, (Latin: “Balance”) in astronomy, 
zodiacal constellation in the southern 
sky lying between Scorpius and Virgo, 
at about 15 hours 30 minutes right 
ascension and 15° south declination. 
Its stars are faint; the brightest star, 
Zubeneschamali (Arabic for “northern 
claw,” as it was earlier regarded as part 
of Scorpius; also called Beta Librae), has 
a magnitude of 2.6. In astrology, Libra is 
the seventh sign of the zodiac, considered 	
as governing the period from about 
September 22 to about October 23. It is 
represented by a woman (sometimes 
identified with Astraea, the Roman goddess 
of justice), holding a balance scale or by the 
balance alone.
