Leo, (Latin: “Lion”) in astronomy, zodiacal 
constellation lying in the northern sky between
Cancer and Virgo, at about 10 hours 30 minutes 
right ascension and 15° north declination. Regulus 
(Latin for “little king”; also called Alpha Leonis), the 
brightest star, is of magnitude 1.35. The November 
meteor shower called the Leonids has its radiant, 
or point of apparent origin, in Leo. Many of the stars 
in Leo form an asterism called the Sickle. In astrology, 
Leo is the fifth sign of the zodiac, considered as 
governing the period from about July 23 to about 
August 22. Its representation as a lion is usually linked 
with the Nemean lion slain by Heracles (Hercules).
