Pisces, (Latin: “Fishes”) in astronomy, zodiacal 
constellation in the northern sky between Aries 
and Aquarius, at about 1 hour right ascension 
and 15° north declination. The vernal equinox, 
the point where the Sun’s annual apparent path 
takes it north of the celestial equator and from 
which celestial longitude and right ascension are 
measured, lies in Pisces. The constellation 
contains only faint stars without any striking grouping; 
the brightest star, Eta Piscium, has a magnitude of 3.6. 
In astrology, Pisces is the 12th sign of the zodiac, 
considered as governing the period from about 
February 19 to about March 20. Its representation as 
two fish tied together is usually related to the Greek
myth of Aphrodite and Eros, who jumped into a river 
to escape the monster Typhon and changed into fish, 
or, alternatively, the two fish that carried them to safety.
